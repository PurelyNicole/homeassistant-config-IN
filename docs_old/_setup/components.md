# Components

Components in Home Assitant are the devices and services that control various aspects within home assistant. Each of these componets may have multiple releated components they use to communicate within the system. For example, Nest has sensors, binary sensors, climate, and camera controls avaliable to it. For simplicity, I've just listed the overarching component here.
