# Devices
These are the physical devices that make my smart home, smart. We started with mostly Z-Wave devices, but then we learned about Tasmota and ESPHome. Tasmota and ESPHome are custom firmware options that allow you to take certain cloud based wi-fi devices and make them run local-only. This greatly reduces the cost of things like switches, outlets, and lights. Nearly all the wifi devics listed here are running one of these firmware options. There are some exceptions, and they have been marked with a ☁️

## Plugs
One change we would make is to use plugs instead of wall outlets where possible. The wall outlets are nice, because they offer a seamless look. But the plugs are easier to fix if something goes wrong. And by wrong, I mean when I do something like upgrade the firmware out of order.
