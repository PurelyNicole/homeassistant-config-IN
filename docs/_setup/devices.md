# Devices
These are the physical devices that make my smart home, smart. We started with mostly Z-Wave devices, but then we learned about Tasmota and ESPHome.

This greatly reduces the cost of things like switches, outlets, and lights. Nearly all the wifi devics listed here are running one of these firmware options. There are some exceptions, and they have been marked with a ☁️
