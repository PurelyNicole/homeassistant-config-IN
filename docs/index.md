# Home Assistant Configuration

The details of the smart home my spouse and I have built and maintained. All our work is stored in my GitHub account, but it has been a team project with each of us taking on the parts that interest us.

## Why Home Assistant?
We had originally set up our smart home using SmartThings. But as our system grew, we became frustrated with the delays involved with connecting to Samsung's servers. Also, we had no control over maintenace times and outages. And if our ISP had an issue, all of our devices became "dumb" devices again. We decided on Home Asisstant because it fit our criteria of:

* Local focused.
* Active development.
* Active community.
* Extensive Integrations

## Build Philosophy
* Technology should fit your life. Your life shouldn't fit technology.
* Automation over remote control.
* Devices should still work if the network goes down.
* Snitches get disassembled and sent to Beelzebot.
